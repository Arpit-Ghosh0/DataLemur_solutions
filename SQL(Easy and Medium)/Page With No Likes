Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page"). Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs. (Facebook SQL Interview)

Code:

select p1.page_id
from pages p1
LEFT JOIN page_likes p2
ON p1.page_id = p2.page_id
where liked_date IS NULL
order by p1.page_id
