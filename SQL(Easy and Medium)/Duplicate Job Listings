Assume you're given a table containing job postings from various companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to retrieve the count of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.
Definition: Duplicate job listings are defined as two job listings within the same company that share identical titles and descriptions. (Linkedin Interview Question)

Code:

with cte as (select company_id, Lower(title),lower(description)
from job_listings
GROUP BY company_id, Lower(title),lower(description)
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT job_id) > 1)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) as duplicate_companies
from cte
