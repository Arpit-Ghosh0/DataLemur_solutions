Your team at JPMorgan Chase is preparing to launch a new credit card, and to gain some insights, you're analyzing how many credit cards were issued each month.
Write a query that outputs the name of each credit card and the difference in the number of issued cards between the month with the highest issuance cards and the lowest issuance. Arrange the results based on the largest disparity.

Code:

with cte as (SELECT card_name, max(issued_amount) as maxm, min(issued_amount) as minm
FROM monthly_cards_issued
GROUP BY card_name)

select card_name,(maxm-minm) as difference
from cte
ORDER BY difference DESC
