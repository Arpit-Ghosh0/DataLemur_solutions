Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

Code:

with cte as (SELECT category, product, SUM(spend) as total 
FROM product_spend
WHERE  EXTRACT(year from transaction_date) = 2022
GROUP BY category, product),
cte2 as 
(select *, row_number() OVER(PARTITION BY category order by total DESC) as rnk
from cte)
select category, product, total as total_spend
from cte2
where rnk <=2
