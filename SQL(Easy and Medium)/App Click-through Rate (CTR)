Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.
Definition and note:
Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

Code:

with cte as (select app_id,
SUM(case when event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as imp,
SUM(case when event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as clk
from events
where EXTRACT(year from timestamp) = 2022
GROUP BY app_id)

select app_id, ROUND((100.0*clk/imp),2) as ctr
from cte
