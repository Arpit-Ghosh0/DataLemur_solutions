Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.
Notes:
Calculate the following percentages:
time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

Code:

with cte as (select b.age_bucket, SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'open' then time_spent else 0 END) as t_o,
SUM(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'send' then time_spent else 0 END) as t_s
from activities a
join age_breakdown b
on a.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY b.age_bucket)


select age_bucket, ROUND(t_s/(t_s+t_o)*100.0,2) as send_perc,ROUND(t_o/(t_s+t_o)*100.0,2) as open_perc
from cte
