Write a function to get the intersection of two lists.

For example, if A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and B = [0, 1, 3, 7] then you should return [1, 3].

Code:

def intersection(a, b):
  intersection_list = []
  for value in a:
    if value in b:
      intersection_list.append(value)
  return intersection_list
