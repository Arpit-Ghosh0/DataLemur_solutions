Given a valid Roman numeral, convert it to an integer. In case you don't think about the Roman empire that often, and need a crash-course on how to go from Superbowl "XLIV" to an actual number, here's the table mapping the numerals to their values:
Symbol	Value
I	1
V	5
X	10
L	50
C	100
D	500
M	1000
The numerals are generally written from largest to smallest from left to right. For example, the number 11 is written as XI, where X represents 10 and I represents 1, so the total is 11.
Similarly, XXX would be 30 (unless we're talking about your browser's search history).

Code:

def romanToInt(s):
	rom={'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100,'D':500,'M':1000}
	ans = 0
	i=0
	while i<len(s):
	  if i + 1 <len(s) and rom[s[i+1]]>rom[s[i]]:
	    ans = ans + (rom[s[i+1]] - rom[s[i]])
	    i=i+2
	  else:
	    ans = ans+rom[s[i]]
	    i=i+1
	    
	return ans
