Given a positive integer n, the Collatz sequence for n,n is generated by repeatedly applying the following operations:If n is even,then n=n/2.If n is odd, then n=3âˆ—n+1
Repeat the above steps until n becomes 1.

Code:

def collatzSteps(n):
    count = 0
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2  # If n is even, divide by 2. '//' is to do integer divisioin in Python
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1  # If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1
        count += 1
    return count
